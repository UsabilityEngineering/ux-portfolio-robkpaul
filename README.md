# Robert's UX Portfolio

I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Chico State, looking to graduate with my Bachelor's of Science Spring of 2024. Prior to this class I interned at Dropbox Summer of 2022 and 2023, and have been involved in Software Engineering since Freshman year of High School through my High School's Robotics Team, the Robo Rockin Bots ([FRC 2035](https://github.com/carmelrobotics)).
